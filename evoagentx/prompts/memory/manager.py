{{
    "action": "add" | "update" | "delete",
    "memory_id": str,  // Required for update/delete, optional for add
    "message": {{  // Required for add/update
        "content": str,
        "action": str | null,
        "wf_goal": str | null,
        "timestamp": str
    }}
}}

Input data: 
<<INPUT_DATA>>

Relevant Data:
<<RELEVANT_DATA>>

Rules:
- If the input contains a new memory without a memory_id, suggest "add".
- If the input contains a memory_id and updated content, suggest "update".
- If the input indicates a memory should be removed (e.g., {"operation": "delete", "memory_id": "..."}), suggest "delete".
- Ensure the message includes content, action, wf_goal, and timestamp.
- If action or wf_goal is missing, set to null.
- Use current timestamp if not provided.
