For example, ouptut the answer in <reasoning>xxx</reasoning> and <answer>xxx</answer> format. \n\nThe following are some examples:\nExample 1:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nLet $n$ be a positive integer.  How many different values can $\\gcd(n + 5, n + 11)$ attain?\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nTo determine how many different values the expression $\\gcd(n + 5, n + 11)$ can attain, we start by using the property of the gcd that states $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, b - a)$ for any integers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we can rewrite the gcd as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) = \\gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = \\gcd(n + 5, 6).\n\\]\n\nThis means we just need to find the possible values of $\\gcd(n + 5, 6)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the values that $n + 5$ can take. As a positive integer $n$ varies, $n + 5$ can take any integer value starting from 6. The integer 6 has the following divisors:\n\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 6\n\nNow, we need to examine the possible values of $\\gcd(n + 5, 6)$ based on the residues of $n + 5$ modulo 6. \n\nWe can define $k = n + 5$. Then, we consider $k \\mod 6$. The possible residues for $k$ (since $n$ is a positive integer and thus $k$ starts at 6) are \\(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\). We compute $\\gcd(k, 6)$ for these cases:\n\n- If \\(k \\equiv 0 \\mod 6\\), then $\\gcd(k, 6) = 6$.\n- If \\(k \\equiv 1 \\mod 6\\), then $\\gcd(k, 6) = 1$.\n- If \\(k \\equiv 2 \\mod 6\\), then $\\gcd(k, 6) = 2$.\n- If \\(k \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\\), then $\\gcd(k, 6) = 3$.\n- If \\(k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\\), then $\\gcd(k, 6) = 2$.\n- If \\(k \\equiv 5 \\mod 6\\), then $\\gcd(k, 6) = 1$.\n\nFrom these calculations, the different values of $\\gcd(n + 5, 6)$ that can be obtained are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Thus, the possible values that $\\gcd(n + 5, n + 11)$ can attain are:\n\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 6\n\nThis gives us a total of 4 different values. Therefore, the final answer is 4.\nanswer:\n4\n\nExample 2:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nFind the largest $x$-value at which the graphs of $f(x)=e^{{3x^2-|\\lfloor x \\rfloor|!}}+\\binom{{22+735235|\\lfloor x \\rfloor |}}{{2356}}+\\phi(|\\lfloor x \\rfloor|+1)+72x^4+3x^3-6x^2+2x+1$ and $g(x)=e^{{3x^2-|\\lfloor x \\rfloor|!}}+\\binom{{22+735235|\\lfloor x \\rfloor |}}{{2356}}+\\phi(|\\lfloor x \\rfloor|+1)+72x^4+4x^3-11x^2-6x+13$ intersect, where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the floor function of $x$, and $\\phi(n)$ denotes the sum of the positive integers $\\le$ and relatively prime to $n$.\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nTo find the largest x-value at which the graphs of f(x) and g(x) intersect, we first observe the expressions for both functions. The major components of f(x) and g(x) are identical until the cubic and quadratic terms. Thus, we focus on the difference between the two functions:\n\nf(x) - g(x) = (3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1) - (4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nf(x) - g(x) = -x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 12.\n\nWe need to solve the equation -x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 12 = 0. This can be rewritten as:\n\nx^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0.\n\nTo find the x-values where this polynomial equals zero, we can use synthetic division or the Rational Root Theorem to test for rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of 12 (\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b16, \u00b112).\n\nAfter testing these values:\n\n1. Testing x = 2:\n   2^3 - 5(2^2) - 8(2) + 12 = 8 - 20 - 16 + 12 = -16 (not a root).\n2. Testing x = 3:\n   3^3 - 5(3^2) - 8(3) + 12 = 27 - 45 - 24 + 12 = -30 (not a root).\n3. Testing x = 4:\n   4^3 - 5(4^2) - 8(4) + 12 = 64 - 80 - 32 + 12 = -36 (not a root).\n4. Testing x = 1:\n   1^3 - 5(1^2) - 8(1) + 12 = 1 - 5 - 8 + 12 = 0 (this is a root).\n\nThus, x = 1 is a root. We can now factor the polynomial by dividing it by (x - 1), yielding:\n\nx^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 4x - 12).\n\nWe can solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x - 12 = 0 using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 48)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 \u221a64] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 8] / 2.\n\nThis gives us two additional solutions:\n\nx = 6 and x = -2.\n\nThe x-values where f(x) and g(x) intersect are x = 1, x = 6, and x = -2. The largest x-value at which the graphs intersect is x = 6. Since we also need to take into account that the floor function may influence values around these intersections, we find that the maximum floor of x gives us the largest integer point of intersection.\nanswer:\n6"}
