We can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) using the first equation: \\(y = 7 - x\\). Substituting this expression for \\(y\\) into the second equation gives us:\n\\[3x + (7 - x) = 45.\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[3x + 7 - x = 45,\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[2x + 7 = 45.\\]\nSubtracting 7 from both sides leads to:\n\\[2x = 38\\]\nand dividing by 2 gives:\n\\[x = 19.\\]\nNext, we substitute \\(x = 19\\) back into the first equation:\n\\[19 + y = 7,\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[y = 7 - 19 = -12.\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\(x^2 - y^2\\). We can use the difference of squares formula, which states that \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b\\). Thus, we first calculate:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y).\n\\]\nCalculating \\(x - y\\):\n\\[\nx - y = 19 - (-12) = 19 + 12 = 31,\n\\]\nand calculating \\(x + y\\):\n\\[\nx + y = 19 + (-12) = 19 - 12 = 7.\n\\]\nUsing these results, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = (31)(7) = 217.\n\\]\nanswer:\n217\n\nExample 2:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nConsider the graph of $$\\frac{{x^3-x^2+x}}{{6x^2-9x}}.$$Let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nTo analyze the function $$\\frac{{x^3-x^2+x}}{{6x^2-9x}}$$, we first need to simplify the expression and identify the holes, vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and oblique asymptotes.\n\n1. **Factoring the numerator and denominator:**\n   The numerator is \\(x^3 - x^2 + x\\). We can factor out an \\(x\\) to get:\n   $$x(x^2 - x + 1)$$\n   The denominator is \\(6x^2 - 9x\\). We can factor out a \\(3x\\) to get:\n   $$3x(2x - 3)$$\n\n   Therefore, the function simplifies to:\n   $$\\frac{{x(x^2 - x + 1)}}{{3x(2x - 3)}}$$\n\n2. **Identifying holes:**\n   A hole occurs where there is a common factor in the numerator and denominator. Here, there is a common factor of \\(x\\), so there is a hole at \\(x = 0\\). Thus, \\(a = 1\\).\n\n3. **Identifying vertical asymptotes:**\n   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but not the numerator. The factored denominator is \\(3x(2x - 3)\\):\n   - Set \\(3x(2x - 3) = 0\\), which gives \\(x = 0\\) (which we accounted for as a hole) and \\(2x - 3 = 0\\), leading to \\(x = \\frac{{3}}{{2}}\\).\n   Thus, there is one vertical asymptote at \\(x = \\frac{{3}}{{2}}\\), so \\(b = 1\\).\n\n4. **Identifying horizontal or oblique asymptotes:**\n   The degrees of the numerator and denominator will determine the presence of horizontal or oblique asymptotes.\n   - The degree of the numerator \\(x^3\\) is 3.\n   - The degree of the denominator \\(6x^2\\) is 2.\n\n   Since the degree of the numerator (3) is greater than the degree of the denominator (2), there is no horizontal asymptote. To confirm this, we note that if the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator, we would have an oblique asymptote. Here, it is indeed the case (degree 3 - degree 2 = 1), thus we find an oblique asymptote.\n\n   Therefore, \\(c = 0\\) and \\(d = 1\\).\n\n5. **Calculating \\(a + 2b + 3c + 4d\\):**\n   Now we substitute the values:\n   - \\(a = 1\\)\n   - \\(b = 1\\)\n   - \\(c = 0\\)\n   - \\(d = 1\\)\n\n   Plugging these into the expression gives:\n   $$1 + 2(1) + 3(0) + 4(1) = 1 + 2 + 0 + 4 = 7$$\n\nThus, the final result is \\(7\\).\nanswer:\n7"}
