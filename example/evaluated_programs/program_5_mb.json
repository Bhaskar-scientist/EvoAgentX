Your response must follow this detailed structure:\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Start by identifying and listing all relevant elements in the given problem, such as numbers, constraints, or conditions that will influence the solution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**: Next, proceed sequentially through each element. Explain your calculations and thought processes transparently. Highlight any assumptions made or mathematical principles applied while exploring the problem.\n\n3. **Solution Derivation**: Conclude with the calculated solution, verifying each step where necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Formatting Requirement**: Adhere strictly to the XML format for your response: \n   - Enclose your reasoning in <reasoning> tags.\n   - Enclose the final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nApply this logical template to deliver a solution that is both comprehensive and aligned with the expectations of structured analytical problem-solving.\n\nThe followings are some required input values: \nproblem: {problem}\n\nThe following are some examples:\nExample 1:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nBeth rolls a fair six-sided die. If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nLet's evaluate each outcome when Beth rolls the die. The possible outcomes are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\n1. **Identifying Prime and Composite Numbers**:\n   - Prime Numbers: 2, 3, 5 (Beth wins 1 dollar for each)\n   - Composite Numbers: 4, 6 (Beth loses 1 dollar for each)\n   - Neither: 1 (Beth neither wins nor loses money)\n\n2. **Calculating the Values**:\n   - For 1: 0 dollars (no win or loss)\n   - For 2: 1 dollar (Beth wins)\n   - For 3: 1 dollar (Beth wins)\n   - For 4: -1 dollar (Beth loses)\n   - For 5: 1 dollar (Beth wins)\n   - For 6: -1 dollar (Beth loses)\n\n3. **Probability of Each Outcome**:\n   Each outcome has a probability of \\( \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\) since the die is fair.\n\n4. **Calculating Expected Value**:\n   The expected value (E) can be calculated as follows:\n   E = (Probability of 1) * (Value of 1) + (Probability of 2) * (Value of 2) + (Probability of 3) * (Value of 3) + (Probability of 4) * (Value of 4) + (Probability of 5) * (Value of 5) + (Probability of 6) * (Value of 6)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   E = \\( \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\cdot (-1) + \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\cdot (-1) \\)\n\n   E = \\( \\frac{{0 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1}}{{6}} \\)\n   E = \\( \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\)\n\nThus, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is \\( \\frac{{1}}{{6}} \\).\nanswer:\n\\frac{{1}}{{6}}\n\nExample 2:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nWhat is the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of three?\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nLet's consider the smallest positive multiples of three. These are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30. To find the sum, we can add these numbers together. \n<sum>\n3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 + 24 + 27 + 30\n</sum>\nCalculating the sum step by step:\n3 + 6 = 9\n9 + 9 = 18\n18 + 12 = 30\n30 + 15 = 45\n45 + 18 = 63\n63 + 21 = 84\n84 + 24 = 108\n108 + 27 = 135\n135 + 30 = 165\nSo, the sum of the 10 smallest positive multiples of three is 165.\nanswer:\n165\n\nExample 3:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nWhen a car's brakes are applied, it travels 5 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 45 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nLet's analyze the problem step by step. The car travels 45 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied. In each subsequent second, it travels 5 feet less than the previous second. This creates a sequence of distances traveled each second until the car comes to a complete stop. \n\n1. First second: 45 feet\n2. Second second: 45 - 5 = 40 feet\n3. Third second: 40 - 5 = 35 feet\n4. Fourth second: 35 - 5 = 30 feet\n5. Fifth second: 30 - 5 = 25 feet\n6. Sixth second: 25 - 5 = 20 feet\n7. Seventh second: 20 - 5 = 15 feet\n8. Eighth second: 15 - 5 = 10 feet\n9. Ninth second: 10 - 5 = 5 feet\n10. Tenth second: 5 - 5 = 0 feet (the car comes to a stop)\n\nNow, we add up the distances traveled during these seconds:\n45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 0 = 225 feet\n\nSo, the total distance the car travels from the time the brakes are applied until it stops is 225 feet.\nanswer:\n225\n\nExample 4:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nIf $\\log_{{3}}6 \\approx 1.63$, what is the value of $\\log_{{9}} 4$, accurate to two decimal places?\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nTo find the value of log<sub>9</sub>4, we can use the change of base formula, which states that log<sub>b</sub>a = log<sub>c</sub>a / log<sub>c</sub>b for any positive base c. \n\nWe will use base 3:\nlog<sub>9</sub>4 = log<sub>3</sub>4 / log<sub>3</sub>9\n\nNext, we know:\nlog<sub>3</sub>9 = log<sub>3</sub>(3<sup>2</sup>) = 2 * log<sub>3</sub>3 = 2, since log<sub>3</sub>3 = 1.\n\nNow we need to find log<sub>3</sub>4.\nWe can express 4 as 2<sup>2</sup>, thus:\nlog<sub>3</sub>4 = log<sub>3</sub>(2<sup>2</sup>) = 2 * log<sub>3</sub>2.\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can find log<sub>3</sub>2 in terms of log<sub>3</sub>6:\nlog<sub>3</sub>2 = log<sub>3</sub>(6/3) = log<sub>3</sub>6 - log<sub>3</sub>3 = log<sub>3</sub>6 - 1.\n\nWe know log<sub>3</sub>6 \u2248 1.63, so:\nlog<sub>3</sub>2 \u2248 1.63 - 1 = 0.63.\n\nNow we substitute this back to find log<sub>3</sub>4:\nlog<sub>3</sub>4 = 2 * log<sub>3</sub>2 \u2248 2 * 0.63 = 1.26.\n\nPutting everything together:\nlog<sub>9</sub>4 = log<sub>3</sub>4 / log<sub>3</sub>9 = 1.26 / 2 = 0.63.\n\nThus, the value of log<sub>9</sub>4, accurate to two decimal places, is approximately 0.63.\nanswer:\n0.63"}
