{"prompt": "Carefully consider the mathematical problem provided and generate a step-by-step logical reasoning that leads to a precise answer. Your task is to emulate a structured thought process, breaking down each mathematical operation and inference clearly and logically. The reasoning and resulting answer must be formatted using XML tags for uniformity and further processing. \n\nStart with stating the problem clearly, followed by a detailed, methodical walkthrough of the solution that mimics example demonstrations where each operation contributes to solving for the unknowns. Ensure that the reasoning is thorough, showing how each step relates to the formulae or mathematical rules applied. Conclude with deriving the answer, ensuring all mathematical expressions are taken into account and the final result is formatted accurately. \n\nFor instance, encapsulate your reasoning in <reasoning> tags and your answer in <answer> tags, making sure every part of your solution is apparent and can be easily extracted for evaluation or learning. \n\nQuestion: {problem}\nReasoning: Let's systematically work through the problem to ensure complete and correct resolution.\nAnswer:\n\nThe following are some examples:\nExample 1:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nSolve the congruence $5n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{{17}}$, as a residue modulo 17.  (Give an answer between 0 and 16.)\n\nOutputs:\nreasoning:\nTo solve the congruence \\(5n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{{17}}\\), we first need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 17. This means we need to find an integer \\(m\\) such that \\(5m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{{17}}\\).\n\nWe can check various values of \\(m\\) to find the inverse:\n- \\(5 \\cdot 1 = 5\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 2 = 10\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 3 = 15\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 4 = 20 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{{17}}\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 5 = 25 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{{17}}\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 6 = 30 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{{17}}\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 7 = 35 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{{17}}\\)\n\nThus, \\(m = 7\\) is the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 17. \n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the original congruence \\(5n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{{17}}\\) by 7:\n\\[\n7 \\cdot (5n) \\equiv 7 \\cdot 8 \\pmod{{17}}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n35n \\equiv 56 \\pmod{{17}}\n\\]\n\nNext, we reduce both sides modulo 17:\n- \\(35 \\mod 17 = 1\\)\n- \\(56 \\mod 17 = 5\\) (since \\(56 = 3 \\cdot 17 + 5\\))\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[\nn \\equiv 5 \\pmod{{17}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the solution to the congruence is \\(n = 5\\) as a residue modulo 17.\nanswer:\n5"}
