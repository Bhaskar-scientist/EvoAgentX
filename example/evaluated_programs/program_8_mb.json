{"prompt": "Given the mathematical or logical problem described, let's carefully dissect and address it step by step. Your task is to break down the problem into manageable components, evaluate each part logically, and systematically develop a solution. Make sure that your reasoning is clear, concise, and follows a logical progression towards the final answer. Your response must follow this detailed structure:\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Start by identifying and listing all relevant elements in the given problem, such as numbers, constraints, or conditions that will influence the solution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**: Next, proceed sequentially through each element. Explain your calculations and thought processes transparently. Highlight any assumptions made or mathematical principles applied while exploring the problem.\n\n3. **Solution Derivation**: Conclude with the calculated solution, verifying each step where necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Formatting Requirement**: Adhere strictly to the XML format for your response: \n   - Enclose your reasoning in <reasoning> tags.\n   - Enclose the final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nApply this logical template to deliver a solution that is both comprehensive and aligned with the expectations of structured analytical problem-solving.\n\nThe followings are some required input values: \nproblem: {problem}"}
