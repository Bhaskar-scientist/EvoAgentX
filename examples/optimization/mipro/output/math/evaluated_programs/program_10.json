        "problem": "A committee is to be made up from a group of 10 candidates. The committee must consist of a chairman and some (not necessarily nonzero) number of members-at-large. How many ways can the committee be chosen? (For example, suppose that Alex is chair while Betty, Carl, and D'Angelo make up the committee. This counts as the same as Alex being chair while Carl, Betty, and D'Angelo make up the committee. It is not the same as Betty being the chair, with Alex, Carl, and D'Angelo making up the committee. It is also not the same as Alex being chair with the committee consisting of Betty and Carl.)",
        "solution": "To form a committee from a group of 10 candidates, we need to select a chairman and then choose some number of members-at-large from the remaining candidates. Here's how we can calculate the total number of ways to form such a committee.\n\n1. **Choose a Chairman**: We have 10 candidates, so there are 10 choices for the chairman.\n\n2. **Choose Members-at-Large**: Once the chairman is chosen, we have 9 candidates left from which we can choose members-at-large. Each of these candidates can either be a member-at-large or not included in the committee.\n\n   The number of ways to choose members-at-large from these 9 candidates can be calculated using the concept of subsets. For each of the 9 remaining candidates, they can either be included or excluded from the committee. Therefore, the total number of subsets of the 9 candidates (which includes the empty subset) is given by \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of candidates:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ways to choose members-at-large} = 2^9 = 512\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine Choices**: Since the choice of the chairman is independent of the choice of the members-at-large, we multiply the number of choices for chairman by the number of ways to choose members-at-large:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Ways} = \\text{Choices for Chairman} \\times \\text{Ways to choose Members-at-Large} = 10 \\times 512 = 5120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ways to form the committee, considering both the chairman and the members-at-large, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5120}\n\\]"
