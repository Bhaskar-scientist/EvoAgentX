There are 10 different choices for the chairman.\n\n2. **Selecting Members-at-Large**:\n   After selecting a chairman, we can choose any subset of the remaining 9 candidates to be members-at-large. Each candidate can either be included in the committee or not, giving us 2 choices (include or not include) for each of the 9 remaining candidates.\n\n   The total number of subsets of a set with \\( n \\) elements is given by \\( 2^n \\). Therefore, for 9 candidates, we have:\n   \\[\n   2^9 = 512\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Committees**:\n   Since the selection of the chairman and the selection of members-at-large are independent choices, we multiply the number of choices for the chairman by the number of subsets of members-at-large:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Committees} = \\text{Choices for Chairman} \\times \\text{Choices for Members-at-Large} = 10 \\times 512 = 5120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ways to form the committee is **5120**."
