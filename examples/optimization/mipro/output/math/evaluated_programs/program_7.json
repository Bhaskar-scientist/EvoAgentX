        "solution": "\nFirst, let's convert the repeating decimals into fractions.\n\n1. **Convert \\(0.8\\overline{4}\\) to a fraction:**\n\n   Let \\(x = 0.8\\overline{4}\\).\n   This means \\(x = 0.844444...\\)\n\n   To eliminate the repeating part:\n   Multiply by \\(10\\) (to move the decimal point one place right) and we have:\n   \\[\n   10x = 8.44444...\n   \\]\n\n   Now, multiply by \\(100\\) (to shift over by two digits):\n   \\[\n   100x = 84.44444...\n   \\]\n\n   Now subtract the first equation from the second:\n   \\[\n   100x - 10x = 84.44444... - 8.44444...\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90x = 76\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{76}{90}\n   \\]\n   We can simplify this:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{38}{45}\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, \\(0.8\\overline{4} = \\frac{38}{45}\\).\n\n2. **Convert \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) to a fraction:**\n\n   Let \\(y = 0.\\overline{4}\\).\n   This means \\(y = 0.44444...\\)\n\n   Multiply by \\(10\\):\n   \\[\n   10y = 4.44444...\n   \\]\n\n   Now, subtracting the initial equation from this:\n   \\[\n   10y - y = 4.44444... - 0.44444...\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9y = 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{4}{9}\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, \\(0.\\overline{4} = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n3. **Now we subtract \\(0.8\\overline{4} - 0.\\overline{4}\\):**\n   This translates to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{38}{45} - \\frac{4}{9}\n   \\]\n\n   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of \\(45\\) and \\(9\\) is \\(45\\).\n\n   To subtract, convert \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) to have a denominator of \\(45\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{9 \\times 5} = \\frac{20}{45}\n   \\]\n\n   Now we can subtract:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{38}{45} - \\frac{20}{45} = \\frac{38 - 20}{45} = \\frac{18}{45}\n   \\]\n\n   Finally, simplify \\(\\frac{18}{45}\\):\n   Both numbers can be divided by \\(9\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18 \\div 9}{45 \\div 9} = \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}\n\\]"
