        "solution": "To determine the number of ways to form the committee consisting of a chairman and some members-at-large from a group of 10 candidates, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose the Chairman**: Since we have 10 candidates, we can choose any one of them to be the chairman. This gives us 10 options for the chairman.\n\n2. **Choose Members-at-Large**: After selecting the chairman, we can select any number (including zero) from the remaining 9 candidates to be members-at-large. The number of ways to choose a subset of these 9 candidates can be represented using the powerset, which includes all possible combinations of these candidates.\n\n   Each candidate can either be included in the subset or not. Therefore, for 9 candidates, the total number of subsets is \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of candidates. In this case, \\(n = 9\\), so the number of subsets is:\n   \\[\n   2^9 = 512\n   \\]\n   This count includes the empty subset (choosing no members-at-large at all).\n\n3. **Total Combinations**: Now we multiply the options for choosing the chairman by the number of ways to choose the members-at-large:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = \\text{(ways to choose chairman)} \\times \\text{(ways to choose members-at-large)} = 10 \\times 512 = 5120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ways to choose the committee is \\( \\boxed{5120} \\)."

Let's consider substituting \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x + 0) = f(x) + f(0) + 2x \\cdot 0,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = f(x) + f(0).\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we conclude that:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 0.\n\\]\n\nNext, let's substitute \\( y = 1 \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x + 1) = f(x) + f(1) + 2x \\cdot 1.\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\nf(x + 1) = f(x) + 4 + 2x.\n\\]\n\nNow, we can explore the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) for some small integer values.
