Please read the problem carefully, analyze the necessary mathematical concepts, and compute the answer step by step. Ensure that your solution is clearly articulated, demonstrating the reasoning process behind your computations.\n\nWhen you arrive at your final answer, format it in the specified box format, for example, \\(\\boxed{{123}}\\).\n\n**Problem:** {problem}\n\n---\n\nThis improved instruction emphasizes the reasoning process and clarity, inviting the LM to present the answer along with an explanation, which could enhance learning outcomes for users engaging with the system.",
