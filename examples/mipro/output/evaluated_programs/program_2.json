Once we have done that, we just need to place the two N's and then the rest of the spots will just be A's. We have 5 spots left, so there are 5 options for where to put the first N and 4 options for where to put the second N. However, the two N's are identical, which means that we've counted each new word twice. So our answer is $\\frac{5\\times5\\times4}{2}=\\boxed{50}$."

We now find that \\[ 3z+4i\\bar{z} = (3a+4b) + (4a+3b)i. \\]So if $3z+4i\\bar{z}=1-8i$ then we must have $3a+4b=1$ and $4a+3b=-8$.  This system of equations is routine to solve, leading to the values $a=-5$ and $b=4$.  Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\\boxed{-5+4i}$."
