Using the property of gcd, d = gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = gcd(n + 5, 6). Therefore, d must be a divisor of 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Thus, d can attain 4 different values: 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nreasoning:\nLet d = gcd(n + 5, n + 11). Using the property of gcd, we have:\nd = gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = gcd(n + 5, 6).\nThus, d must be a divisor of 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
