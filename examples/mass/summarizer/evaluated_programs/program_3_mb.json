How many different values can $\\gcd(n + 5, n + 11)$ attain?\ncontext:\nNot provided\n\nOutputs:\nsummary:\nLet d = gcd(n + 5, n + 11). Using the property of gcd, d = gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = gcd(n + 5, 6). Therefore, d must be a divisor of 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Thus, d can attain 4 different values: 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nreasoning:\nLet d = gcd(n + 5, n + 11). Using the property of gcd, we have:\nd = gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = gcd(n + 5, 6).\nThus, d must be a divisor of 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, d can attain 4 different values: 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nanswer:\n4", "predictor": "To solve the given mathematical problem, we will follow a systematic approach to extract relevant information from the provided context. \n\nQuestion: {problem} \nContext: {context}\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer.

If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.\ncontext:\nNot provided\n\nOutputs:\nsummary:\nBeth can roll a 6-sided die with the following outcomes: 1 (nothing happens), 2 (prime, wins $1), 3 (prime, wins $1), 4 (composite, loses $1), 5 (prime, wins $1), 6 (composite, loses $1). The probabilities are: P(1) = 1/6, P(2) = 1/6, P(3) = 1/6, P(4) = 1/6, P(5) = 1/6, P(6) = 1/6. Expected value calculation: E = (1/6 * 0) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) = (0 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1) / 6 = 1/6.\nreasoning:\nTo find the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win when she rolls a fair six-sided die, we first identify the outcomes and their corresponding values. If she rolls: 1, nothing happens (0 dollars); 2, she wins 1 dollar; 3, she wins 1 dollar; 4, she loses 1 dollar; 5, she wins 1 dollar; and 6, she loses 1 dollar. The probabilities of rolling each side of the die are equal: 1/6 for each outcome. We calculate the expected value (E) by multiplying each outcome's value by its probability and summing the results:\n\nE = (1/6 * 0) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1)\n= (0 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1) / 6 \n= 1/6.\n\nThus, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 1/6.\nanswer:\n1/6"}
