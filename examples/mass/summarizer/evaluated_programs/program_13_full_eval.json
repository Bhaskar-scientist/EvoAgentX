If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.\ncontext:\nNot provided\n\nOutputs:\nsummary:\nBeth can roll a 6-sided die with the following outcomes: 1 (nothing happens), 2 (prime, wins $1), 3 (prime, wins $1), 4 (composite, loses $1), 5 (prime, wins $1), 6 (composite, loses $1). The probabilities are: P(1) = 1/6, P(2) = 1/6, P(3) = 1/6, P(4) = 1/6, P(5) = 1/6, P(6) = 1/6. Expected value calculation: E = (1/6 * 0) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) = (0 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1) / 6 = 1/6.\nreasoning:\nTo find the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win when she rolls a fair six-sided die, we first identify the outcomes and their corresponding values. If she rolls: 1, nothing happens (0 dollars); 2, she wins 1 dollar; 3, she wins 1 dollar; 4, she loses 1 dollar; 5, she wins 1 dollar; and 6, she loses 1 dollar. The probabilities of rolling each side of the die are equal: 1/6 for each outcome. We calculate the expected value (E) by multiplying each outcome's value by its probability and summing the results:\n\nE = (1/6 * 0) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1)\n= (0 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1) / 6 \n= 1/6.\n\nThus, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 1/6.\nanswer:\n1/6", "predictor": "To solve the given mathematical problem, we will follow a systematic approach to extract relevant information from the provided context. \n\nQuestion: {problem} \nContext: {context}\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer.

We have the equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 7 \\)\n2. \\( 3x + y = 45 \\)\n\nFirst, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) from the first equation:\n\\( y = 7 - x \\).\n\nNext, we substitute \\( y \\) into the second equation:\n\\( 3x + (7 - x) = 45 \\).\n\nNow, simplify this equation:\n\\( 3x + 7 - x = 45 \\)\n\\( 2x + 7 = 45 \\).\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\\( 2x = 38 \\).\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\\( x = 19 \\).\n\nNow that we have \\( x \\), we can find \\( y \\):\n\\( y = 7 - x = 7 - 19 = -12 \\).\n\nNext, we need to evaluate \\( x^2 - y^2 \\). We can use the difference of squares formula:\n\\( x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) \\).\n\nNow we calculate \\( x - y \\) and \\( x + y \\):\n\\( x - y = 19 - (-12) = 19 + 12 = 31 \\).\n\\( x + y = 19 + (-12) = 19 - 12 = 7 \\).\n\nNow substituting back into the difference of squares formula we have:\n\\( x^2 - y^2 = (31)(7) = 217 \\).\nanswer:\n217"}
