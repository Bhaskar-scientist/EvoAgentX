If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.\ncontext:\nNot provided\n\nOutputs:\nsummary:\nBeth can roll a 6-sided die with the following outcomes: 1 (nothing happens), 2 (prime, wins $1), 3 (prime, wins $1), 4 (composite, loses $1), 5 (prime, wins $1), 6 (composite, loses $1). The probabilities are: P(1) = 1/6, P(2) = 1/6, P(3) = 1/6, P(4) = 1/6, P(5) = 1/6, P(6) = 1/6. Expected value calculation: E = (1/6 * 0) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) = (0 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1) / 6 = 1/6.\nreasoning:\nTo find the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win when she rolls a fair six-sided die, we first identify the outcomes and their corresponding values. If she rolls: 1, nothing happens (0 dollars); 2, she wins 1 dollar; 3, she wins 1 dollar; 4, she loses 1 dollar; 5, she wins 1 dollar; and 6, she loses 1 dollar. The probabilities of rolling each side of the die are equal: 1/6 for each outcome. We calculate the expected value (E) by multiplying each outcome's value by its probability and summing the results:\n\nE = (1/6 * 0) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1) + (1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * -1)\n= (0 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1) / 6 \n= 1/6.\n\nThus, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 1/6.\nanswer:\n1/6", "predictor": "To solve the given mathematical problem, we will follow a systematic approach to extract relevant information from the provided context. \n\nQuestion: {problem} \nContext: {context}\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer.

(Give an answer between 0 and 16.)\ncontext:\nNot provided\n\nOutputs:\nsummary:\nTo solve the congruence $5n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{{17}}$, first find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 17. The inverse is 7, as $5 \\times 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{{17}}$. Multiply the entire congruence by 7: $n \\equiv 7 \\times 8 \\pmod{{17}}$. This gives $n \\equiv 56 \\pmod{{17}}$. Reducing 56 modulo 17, we find $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{{17}}$. Thus, the answer is 5.\nreasoning:\nTo solve the congruence 5n \u2261 8 (mod 17), we first need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 17. We check for a number x such that 5x \u2261 1 (mod 17). Testing values, we find that 5 * 7 = 35 which gives 35 mod 17 = 1, so the inverse is 7. Next, we multiply the entire congruence by 7: 7 * (5n) \u2261 7 * 8 (mod 17), simplifying to n \u2261 56 (mod 17). Finally, we reduce 56 modulo 17: 56 - 3*17 = 56 - 51 = 5. Therefore, the solution is n \u2261 5 (mod 17).\nanswer:\n5"}
