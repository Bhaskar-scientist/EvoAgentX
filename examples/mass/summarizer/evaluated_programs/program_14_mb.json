Using the property of gcd, d = gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = gcd(n + 5, 6). Therefore, d must be a divisor of 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Thus, d can attain 4 different values: 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nreasoning:\nLet d = gcd(n + 5, n + 11). Using the property of gcd, we have:\nd = gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = gcd(n + 5, 6).\nThus, d must be a divisor of 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

The inverse is 7, as $5 \\times 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{{17}}$. Multiply the entire congruence by 7: $n \\equiv 7 \\times 8 \\pmod{{17}}$. This gives $n \\equiv 56 \\pmod{{17}}$. Reducing 56 modulo 17, we find $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{{17}}$. Thus, the answer is 5.\nreasoning:\nTo solve the congruence 5n \u2261 8 (mod 17), we first need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 17. We check for a number x such that 5x \u2261 1 (mod 17). Testing values, we find that 5 * 7 = 35 which gives 35 mod 17 = 1, so the inverse is 7. Next, we multiply the entire congruence by 7: 7 * (5n) \u2261 7 * 8 (mod 17), simplifying to n \u2261 56 (mod 17). Finally, we reduce 56 modulo 17: 56 - 3*17 = 56 - 51 = 5. Therefore, the solution is n \u2261 5 (mod 17).\nanswer:\n5"}
