Substituting \\( y \\) into the second equation gives \\( 3x + (7 - x) = 45 \\), simplifying to \\( 2x + 7 = 45 \\). Solving for \\( x \\) yields \\( 2x = 38 \\) or \\( x = 19 \\). Substituting \\( x \\) back into \\( y = 7 - x \\) gives \\( y = 7 - 19 = -12 \\). The expression \\( x^2 - y^2 \\) can be evaluated as \\( (x+y)(x-y) = 7(19 - (-12)) = 7(31) = 217 \\).\nreasoning:\nTo solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) given the equations \\( x+y = 7 \\) and \\( 3x+y = 45 \\), we first express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) from the first equation as \\( y = 7 - x \\). Substituting \\( y \\) into the second equation gives us \\( 3x + (7 - x) = 45 \\). Simplifying this, we have \\( 3x + 7 - x = 45 \\), which leads to \\( 2x + 7 = 45 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), we find \\( 2x = 38 \\) or \\( x = 19 \\). Substituting \\( x \\) back into \\( y = 7 - x \\), we get \\( y = 7 - 19 = -12 \\). Now, we evaluate the expression \\( x^2 - y^2 \\). Using the difference of squares formula, \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) \\). We know \\( x+y = 7 \\) and \\( x-y = 19 - (-12) = 31 \\). Thus, we have \\( x^2 - y^2 = 7 \\cdot 31 = 217 \\).\nanswer:\n217", "predictor": "Given a mathematical problem and any contextual information, summarize the problem logically and provide detailed reasoning to derive the answer step by step.
