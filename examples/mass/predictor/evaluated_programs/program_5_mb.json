{"prompt": "Let's analyze the mathematical problem carefully to devise a structured approach for our solution.\n\nQuestion: {problem}\nContext: {context}\nLet's proceed step by step to understand the underlying concepts and calculations necessary to arrive at the answer. \nWe will evaluate the problem in a logical manner, including any relevant formulas or principles that pertain to the mathematical concepts involved. \nFinally, provide the answer in the required XML format, ensuring that the reasoning behind the calculations is clearly articulated.\n\nOutput Format: \n<reasoning>{{Your detailed reasoning goes here}}</reasoning>\n<answer>{{Your final answer here}}</answer>\n\nThe following are some examples:\nExample 1:\nInputs:\nproblem:\nBeth rolls a fair six-sided die. If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.\ncontext:\nNot provided\n\nOutputs:\nanswer:\n1/6"}
