                "reasoning": "To analyze the function $$f(x) = \\frac{x^3 - x^2 + x}{6x^2 - 9x},$$ we start by factoring the numerator and denominator.\n\n1. Factoring the numerator: \n   $$x^3 - x^2 + x = x(x^2 - x + 1).$$\n   The quadratic $x^2 - x + 1$ has no real roots (its discriminant is negative). Hence, the numerator only has a root at $x=0$.\n\n2. Factoring the denominator:\n   $$6x^2 - 9x = 3x(2x - 3).$$\n   This gives roots at $x=0$ (which we already accounted for) and $x=\\frac{3}{2}$. \n\nNext, let's identify the characteristics of the graph:\n\n- **Holes**: A hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator share a common factor. Here, $x$ (which corresponds to $x=0$) is a common factor, creating a hole at $x=0$. Thus, \\(a = 1\\).\n\n- **Vertical Asymptotes**: Vertical asymptotes occur at values of \\(x\\) where the denominator equals zero but the numerator does not. Since $6x^2 - 9x = 0$ gives us $x=0$ and $x=\\frac{3}{2}$, the vertical asymptote occurs at $x=\\frac{3}{2}$. Thus, \\(b = 1\\).\n\n- **Horizontal Asymptotes**: To find horizontal asymptotes, we examine the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The degree of the numerator (3) is greater than that of the denominator (2), which means there is no horizontal asymptote. As such, \\(c = 0\\).\n\n- **Oblique Asymptotes**: Since the degree of the numerator is one more than that of the denominator, we can perform polynomial long division. Dividing \\(x^3 - x^2 + x\\) by \\(6x^2 - 9x\\) gives us an oblique asymptote. Thus, \\(d = 1\\).\n\nNow we can calculate \\(a + 2b + 3c + 4d\\):\n$$a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 1 + 2(1) + 3(0) + 4(1) = 1 + 2 + 0 + 4 = 7.$$",
