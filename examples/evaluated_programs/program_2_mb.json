                "reasoning": "Let's denote \\( d = \\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) \\). Since the gcd is computed using linear combinations, we can express \\( d \\) as follows:\n\\[\nd = \\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) = \\gcd(n + 5, (n + 11) - (n + 5)) = \\gcd(n + 5, 6).\n\\]\nThis means that \\( d \\) must divide 6. The positive divisors of 6 are: 1, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, we need to check whether \\( d \\) can take all these values as \\( n \\) varies over the positive integers. \n\n1. For \\( d = 1 \\):\n   We choose \\( n = 1 \\). Then \\( \\gcd(6, 12) = 6 \\). We need \\( n = 2 \\) for \\( \\gcd(7, 13) = 1 \\).\n   \n2. For \\( d = 2 \\):\n   Select \\( n = 1 \\) again gives \\( \\gcd(6, 12) = 6 \\), we can try \\( n = 4 \\) since \\( \\gcd(9, 15) = 3 \\). \\( n=1 \\) leads to odd positions giving no remainder with 2.\n\n3. For \\( d = 3 \\):\n   Choosing \\( n = 1\\) gives \\( \\gcd(6, 12) = 6\\). Increase like 3 also works such as \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n4. For \\( d = 6 \\):\n   Try \\( n = 1 \\), sets maximum too high for example starts crossing - For this, \\( \\gcd(9,15) = 3\\) but remainders match high times when n drops low.\n\nSince we've found possible n's yielding values 1, 2, 3 and 6 as gcd candidates of (6), hence they all effectively appear at different combinations.\n\nIn conclusion, the possible values that \\( \\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) \\) can attain are indeed 1, 2, 3, and 6, providing 4 different values.",

                "reasoning": "To analyze the function $$\\frac{x^3-x^2+x}{6x^2-9x},$$ we start by factoring both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nFirst, we factor the numerator:\n$$x^3 - x^2 + x = x(x^2 - x + 1).$$\nThis quadratic $x^2 - x + 1$ does not have real roots, since its discriminant $$(-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 - 4 = -3$$ is negative.\n\nNext, we factor the denominator:\n$$6x^2 - 9x = 3x(2x - 3).$$\nThis gives us roots at $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of holes, vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and oblique asymptotes:\n\n1. **Holes** (where both the numerator and denominator equal zero):\n   - The numerator $x^3 - x^2 + x$ equals zero at $x = 0$. The denominator $6x^2 - 9x$ also equals zero at $x = 0$. Therefore, there is a hole at $x = 0$. \n   - This gives us **1 hole** ($a = 1$).\n\n2. **Vertical Asymptotes** (where the denominator is zero but the numerator is not):\n   - The denominator has a factor of $3x(2x - 3)$, which gives a vertical asymptote at $x = \\frac{3}{2}$, since the numerator does not equal zero there.\n   - Thus, there is **1 vertical asymptote** ($b = 1$).\n\n3. **Horizontal Asymptotes** (determined by the degrees of the numerator and denominator):\n   - The degree of the numerator is $3$ and the degree of the denominator is $2$. Because the degree of the numerator is greater than that of the denominator, we do not have a horizontal asymptote.\n   - This gives us **0 horizontal asymptotes** ($c = 0$).\n\n4. **Oblique Asymptotes** (when the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than that of the denominator):\n   - Since the degree of the numerator (3) is one more than the degree of the denominator (2), we can find an oblique asymptote by performing polynomial long division on the function.\n   - This will yield an oblique asymptote, thus we have **1 oblique asymptote** ($d = 1$).\n\nNow, we calculate the final expression:\n$$a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 1 + 2(1) + 3(0) + 4(1) = 1 + 2 + 0 + 4 = 7.$$",
