                "problem": "Beth rolls a fair six-sided die. If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
                "reasoning": "To find the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win or lose after rolling a six-sided die, we first identify the possible outcomes on the die and their associated monetary values:\n- The possible outcomes when rolling a die are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n- The prime numbers among these outcomes are 2, 3, and 5. Rolling any of these results in winning 1 dollar.\n- The composite numbers are 4 and 6. Rolling either of these results in losing 1 dollar.\n- Rolling a 1 results in no win or loss (0 dollars).\n\nNow we summarize the outcomes and their probabilities:\n- Rolling a prime number (2, 3, 5): 3 outcomes (winning 1 dollar) \n- Rolling a composite number (4, 6): 2 outcomes (losing 1 dollar) \n- Rolling a 1: 1 outcome (0 dollars)\n\nThe probabilities for each outcome when rolling a fair die are all equal at \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\):\n- Winning 1 dollar (rolling 2, 3, or 5): Probability = \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- Losing 1 dollar (rolling 4 or 6): Probability = \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- No win or loss (rolling 1): Probability = \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\nNext, we calculate the expected value (E) using the formula:\nE = (Probability of winning 1 dollar) \u00d7 (Amount won) + (Probability of losing 1 dollar) \u00d7 (Amount lost) + (Probability of no win\/loss) \u00d7 (Amount zero)\n= \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot -1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0\\right) \\)\n\nCalculating this gives:\n= \\( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} + 0 \\)\n= \\( \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\nThus, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).",

The smallest positive multiples of three are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30. Next, we sum these numbers: 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 + 24 + 27 + 30.

A car goes 45 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
                "reasoning": "To find the total distance the car travels after the brakes are applied until it comes to a complete stop, we start with the information given:\n- In the first second after the brakes are applied, the car travels 45 feet.\n- In each subsequent second, the distance traveled decreases by 5 feet until the car stops.\n\nWe can outline the distances traveled in each second:\n1. First second: 45 feet\n2. Second second: 45 - 5 = 40 feet\n3. Third second: 40 - 5 = 35 feet\n4. Fourth second: 35 - 5 = 30 feet\n5. Fifth second: 30 - 5 = 25 feet\n6. Sixth second: 25 - 5 = 20 feet\n7. Seventh second: 20 - 5 = 15 feet\n8. Eighth second: 15 - 5 = 10 feet\n9. Ninth second: 10 - 5 = 5 feet\n10. Tenth second: 5 - 5 = 0 feet (the car stops)\n\nNow we add the distances for each second until the car stops:\nTotal distance = 45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 0\n\nCalculating this:\n- 45 + 40 = 85\n- 85 + 35 = 120\n- 120 + 30 = 150\n- 150 + 25 = 175\n- 175 + 20 = 195\n- 195 + 15 = 210\n- 210 + 10 = 220\n- 220 + 5 = 225\n- 225 + 0 = 225\n\nThus, the total distance traveled from the time the brakes are applied until the car stops is 225 feet.",

                "reasoning": "To find the value of \\( \\log_{9} 4 \\), we can use the change of base formula. The change of base formula states that \\( \\log_{b} a = \\frac{\\log_{c} a}{\\log_{c} b} \\) for any positive \\( c \\). We can use base \\( 3 \\) for convenience. Therefore,\n\\[\n\\log_{9} 4 = \\frac{\\log_{3} 4}{\\log_{3} 9}.\n\\]\nWe know that \\( \\log_{3} 9 = \\log_{3} (3^2) = 2 \\). Hence, we need to determine \\( \\log_{3} 4 \\). \n\nSince \\( 4 = 2^2 \\) and we want \\( \\log_{3} 4 \\), we can use \\( \\log_{3} 4 = \\log_{3} (2^2) = 2 \\log_{3} 2 \\). To find \\( \\log_{3} 2 \\), we can use the fact that \\( \\log_{3} 6 \\) is given:\n\\[\n\\log_{3} 6 = \\log_{3} (2 \\cdot 3) = \\log_{3} 2 + \\log_{3} 3 = \\log_{3} 2 + 1.\n\\]\nFrom this, we see that:\n\\[\n\\log_{3} 2 = \\log_{3} 6 - 1 \\approx 1.63 - 1 = 0.63.\n\\]\nNow, substituting back,\n\\[\n\\log_{3} 4 = 2 \\log_{3} 2 \\approx 2 \\times 0.63 = 1.26.\n\\]\nNow we can compute \\( \\log_{9} 4 \\):\n\\[\n\\log_{9} 4 = \\frac{\\log_{3} 4}{\\log_{3} 9} = \\frac{1.26}{2} \\approx 0.63.\n\\]\nSo the final answer to two decimal places is \\( 0.63 \\).",
