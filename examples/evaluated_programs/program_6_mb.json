                "reasoning": "To solve the congruence \\(5n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{17}\\), we first need to isolate \\(n\\). This requires finding the multiplicative inverse of \\(5\\) modulo \\(17\\), which is a number \\(m\\) such that \\(5m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}\\). We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n1. \\(17 = 3 \\times 5 + 2\\)\n2. \\(5 = 2 \\times 2 + 1\\)\n3. \\(2 = 2 \\times 1 + 0\\)\n\nBack substituting to express \\(1\\):\n1. \\(1 = 5 - 2 \\times 2\\)\n2. Substitute for \\(2\\): \\(2 = 17 - 3 \\times 5\\)\n3. Therefore, \\(1 = 5 - 2 \\times (17 - 3 \\times 5) = 7 \\times 5 - 2 \\times 17\\)\n\nThus, \\(m \\equiv 7 \\pmod{17}\\) is the multiplicative inverse of \\(5\\). We multiply both sides of the original congruence by \\(7\\):\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 5n \\equiv 7 \\times 8 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\n\\[\nn \\equiv 56 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\nNow we reduce \\(56 \\mod 17\\):\n\n\\[\n56 \\div 17 = 3 \\quad \\text{(the quotient)}\n\\]\n\\[\n56 - 3 \\times 17 = 56 - 51 = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{17}\\). The residue between \\(0\\) and \\(16\\) is \\(5\\).",

We have 5 spots left, so there are 5 options for where to put the first N and 4 options for where to put the second N.
